We have not registered your flood risk activity exemption
because it's in an environmentally sensitive location
-----------------------------------------------------

Your reference is <%= @presenter.reference_number %>

You must not do any work on the proposed activity.

What you can do
---------------
If you want to do the work at this location, you will have to apply for a permit:
https://www.gov.uk/guidance/flood-risk-activities-environmental-permits

If you are able to do the activity at a different place you might be able to register an exemption. Contact us to check a new location.

You can't appeal because your activity is in an environmentally sensitive location. That means you can't meet the conditions for an exemption and would need to apply for a permit.
